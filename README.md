# UpSkilling

Hi 👋 I’m Yash, and this repository is my **Upskilling Journey to become a FullStack QA Engineer**.  

Here, I document everything I learn about **Software Testing** – from fundamentals to advanced tools – including:  
- 📘 Manual Testing (Test Cases, Checklists, Test Scenarios)  
- 🌐 API Testing (Postman Collections, Newman Reports, Assertions)  
- 🗄️ Database Testing (SQL Queries & Data Validations)  
- 🤖 Automation Testing (Selenium + Java, TestNG, Framework Design)  

This repo is both my **learning journal** and a **knowledge base** for anyone starting in QA.  
Feel free to explore, learn, and share feedback 🚀
